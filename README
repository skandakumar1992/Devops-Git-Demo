# DevOps Git Demo

Short description: sample repo for learning Git + GitHub best practices (branches, PRs, tags).

## Branch strategy
- `main` — protected, production-ready
- `dev` — integration
- `feature/*` — short-lived feature branches

## How to use
1. Clone repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<name> dev`
3. Make changes, commit, push: `git push -u origin feature/<name>`
4. Open PR: feature → dev. After review and merge, delete branch.
5. When dev is stable, open PR: dev → main (release).
